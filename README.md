# Portfolio
This is my Data Structures and Algorithms portfolio
Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Portfolio
Project Overview
This is a simple DSA Portfolio built using basic HTML and CSS. It serves as a showcase of fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms, with descriptions, visual representations, and code snippets. The portfolio provides an easy-to-navigate interface for learners and developers interested in improving their algorithmic skills.

Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS
No JavaScript or backend is used (keeping it simple)
Features
✅ Clean and responsive UI with easy navigation
✅ Sections for popular data structures and algorithms
✅ Embedded code snippets for reference
✅ Simple yet well-structured design

Sections Included in the Portfolio
1. Home Page (index.html)
Introduction to Data Structures & Algorithms
Importance of DSA in problem-solving and coding interviews
2. Data Structures (arrays.html, linkedlist.html)
Arrays – Definition, operations, complexity, and example code
Linked Lists – Types (Singly, Doubly, Circular), operations, and example code
3. Algorithms (sorting.html, searching.html)
Sorting Algorithms – Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, etc.
Searching Algorithms – Linear Search, Binary Search, etc.
How It Works
The home page (index.html) contains a navigation menu linking to different DSA topics.
Each topic page explains the concept with theory, diagrams, and example code snippets.
The website is styled using basic CSS for a clean and readable layout.
